Good day

For this software, it's important that you run the code sequentially.

The LinkToDataset.txt file has the dataset name and link. For my data science
project you will need to mount a drive of your own. Make sure you add the
dataset provided to your own google drive. 

Note that results you get will be different than the results in my
report because we are using machine learning classifiers and batches
of different samples are fed to each model.

Thank you for reading
